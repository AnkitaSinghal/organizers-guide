 Which information I give you now:  
  
short introduction about me and my motivation  
information about installation  
  
1\) no PC  
2\) locally  
3\) online editor  
  
my contact details  
some general stuff  
  
  
**Who am I?**  
My name is Robert Willemelis, 32 and I am a Berlin-based Frontend Developer at STRATO AG. I made an apprenticeship as "IT specialist for application development" some years ago and now I'm a passionate Frontend Developer with Angular.  
  
  
**my motivation:**  
For me, software development is not about being a nerd with a lot of know-how in everything, but its a continuous process of learning from each other and new techniques. I am a political people and I am convinced that our developer community needs more diversity because there are a lot more clever people outside than just white male nerds like me :-\)  
In the last years, I attended a lot of conferences and the best talks was from brilliant women with brilliant ideas and thoughts. And I want more of that. My goal for the workshop is not about helping you, its about learning Angular together and learning from each other to improve our skills.  
I am part if the organizing team of ngGirls.  
   
   
**Installing instructions**  
  
1\) no PC: If you don't have a laptop  
We will find a solution for you. Either my laptop or another laptop or we do pair programming \(two people solve together the tutorial\). If you are able to organize a laptop: let me know.  
  
2\) locally:  at your PC  
If you want to do it locally, you need the instructions for the Angular CLI:  
[https://ng-girls.gitbook.io/todo-list-tutorial/installations  ](https://ng-girls.gitbook.io/todo-list-tutorial/installations)  
  
Following you find for this some suggestions:  
   
It could take you 30min but it should not take you longer than 2 hours. If you are stuck, please contact me. You probably need administrator privileges, take care if u have an x86 \(32 bit\) or x64 \(64 bit\) system when you install NodeJS.  
   
**What I recommend:**  
Git: [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win) =&gt; install also the git bash when you asked for \(I use it as a terminal for git, node and the angular CLI\)  
Browser: Firefox or Chrome, I am using Chrome  
IDE \(Editor\): I suggest Visual Studio Code  
   
A\) for windows users:  
  
my personal settings in the Visual Studio Code Editor  
  
Plugins:  
  
[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)  
[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer)  
\(the other suggested plugins you can install, but don't have to\)  
  
Node:  
you have 2 ways:  
1.  Installing node 10.9 or higher  
2.  install the node version manager which enables you to change the node version:  
  
Install: [https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)  
make sure u deleted any existing nodeJS installation directories \(e.g., "C:\Program Files\nodejs"\) and npm install location \(e.g. "C:\Users&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Roaming\npm"\)  
if installed, open the console \(e.g. the git bash\) and install your favorite node version, e.g.  
  
        nvm install 10.9  
  
and then activate it by:  
  
         nvm use 10.9  
  
the installation of nodeJS and the angular CLI could take a while. Take a coffee

B\) for Mac OS users \(only\):  
  
We recommend using Homebrew: [https://brew.sh/index\_de.html](https://brew.sh/index_de.html)  
  
It is a package manager for Mac and after following the installation guide you can install the needed environments with the following terminal commands:  
  
    brew install node@10  
    brew install git  
  
3\) online editor: Stackblitz  
If you are not able to install the angular CLI we have an online alternative called stackblitz:  [https://ng-girls.gitbook.io/todo-list-tutorial/v/stackblitz/installations  ](https://ng-girls.gitbook.io/todo-list-tutorial/v/stackblitz/installations)
